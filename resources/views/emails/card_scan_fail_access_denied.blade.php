Before involving another human, please log in to your account (https://denhac.org/my-account) and click on "My Subscription" to see if your subscription is active. If it is not, it's very possible it was automatically suspended because a payment didn't go through on an order. Simply click "Orders" to the left, pay for the one that didn't go through, and your subscription should be re-activated.<br>
<br>

Again, feel free to reply to this email if you have any issues, and we'll do our best to help out.<br>
